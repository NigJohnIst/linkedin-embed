🛡️Navigating the New Industrial Era: Why "Responsible AI" is the Key to the Energy Transition

The energy landscape in Norway and the EU is no longer just about extraction or production; it’s about intelligence, accountability, and sovereignty. Whether we are talking about Offshore Wind, CCUS, or Circular Manufacturing, the common denominator is data. But as the EU AI Act moves from draft to reality, the "Black Box" approach to AI is dead. Industry leaders now require systems that are not just smart, but explainable (XAI) and compliant.

🛡️A Multi-Vertical Architecture for Trust

I’ve developed a Sovereign AI framework designed to handle the "mix" of challenges we face today. This architecture (see diagram) integrates Responsible AI directly into the industrial workflow:

For Offshore Wind: AI-driven predictive maintenance that explains why a turbine needs service, reducing O&M costs while maintaining human oversight.

🛡️For Carbon Accounting & CCUS: 
A "G1-G5" data governance pipeline that ensures carbon credits and emission reports are audit-ready and legally defensible.

For Smart Manufacturing: Bridging the gap between SAP S/4HANA and the edge, ensuring that AI-driven automation respects both safety protocols and EU data residency laws.

🛡️ Value Proposition: Bridging Technology & Compliance
Over the years, I have focused on delivering more than just code. I deliver industrial-grade trust. My track record includes:

🛡️Sovereign Data Infrastructure: 
Building OCI/AWS environments that keep Norwegian energy data within national borders (Schrems II compliant).

Hybrid ERP Integration: Deep-tier integration of AI with ServiceNow and SAP, turning raw telemetry into actionable work orders and financial records.

XAI Implementation: 
Moving beyond "predictions" to "explanations." I implement SHAP/LIME frameworks so engineers and regulators can see the "why" behind the AI.

End-to-End Delivery: 
From initial risk classification under the EU AI Act to deploying live inference pipelines in complex industrial environments.

🛡️Let’s Build What’s Next (Open for Partnerships & Roles)
The complexity of today's energy market requires a collaborative ecosystem. I am currently open to new professional opportunities and looking to connect with partners who are serious about scaling Responsible AI.

I am looking to connect with:

Industrial Leaders: 
Seeking a technical lead or consultant to navigate AI compliance and Hybrid ERP roadmaps.

Tech Partners: Companies in the IoT, Wind, or Carbon space looking to integrate a robust XAI and Governance layer into their stack.

Visionary Teams: I am Open to Work in roles that demand a blend of high-level strategy, AI ethics, and deep technical architecture.

The future of energy is transparent. Let's build it that way.
